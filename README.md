	1.	Binary Option Prices:
	•	The notebook computes the prices of call and put binary options for Ethereum (ETH) under different scenarios. For instance:
	•	One scenario shows the call option price as 0.1873 and the put option price as 0.8127.
	•	Another scenario shows the call option price as 0.0508 and the put option price as 0.9492.
	•	These prices indicate the likelihood of the options finishing in-the-money (ITM) based on the underlying assumptions and market conditions.
	2.	Volatility Annualization:
	•	The notebook includes a note stating that the annualization of volatility is specifically for hourly data and should not be used for daily data. This is a crucial point for ensuring accurate volatility calculations.
	3.	Visualizations:
	•	Several plots are generated to analyze the impact of different factors on the pricing of binary options:
	•	A plot showing the relationship between volatility and option prices.
	•	A plot illustrating the effect of maturity (time to expiration) on option prices.
	•	A plot depicting the influence of the spot price (current price) of Ethereum on option prices.
	4.	Further Pricing Results:
	•	Additional binary option prices are provided under different conditions:
	•	In one case, the call option price is 0.2035 and the put option price is 0.7965.
	•	In another case, the call option price is 0.2127 and the put option price is 0.7873.
