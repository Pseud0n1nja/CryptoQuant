Pricing ETH Binary Options

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an in-depth analysis of pricing Ethereum (ETH) binary options. Binary options are a type of financial derivative where the payoff is either a fixed amount of money or nothing at all. This notebook uses various financial models and sensitivity analyses to determine the prices of call and put binary options for Ethereum under different market conditions.

Introduction

Binary options offer a straightforward way to speculate on the price movements of an asset. In this repository, we focus on binary options for Ethereum (ETH), a popular cryptocurrency. The provided Jupyter notebook includes detailed computations, visualizations, and explanations to help users understand the factors affecting binary option prices. This can be valuable for traders, analysts, and anyone interested in financial derivatives.

Insights

Binary Option Prices

The notebook computes the prices of call and put binary options for Ethereum under different scenarios:

	•	Scenario 1:
	•	Call Option Price: 0.1873
	•	Put Option Price: 0.8127
	•	Scenario 2:
	•	Call Option Price: 0.0508
	•	Put Option Price: 0.9492

These prices indicate the likelihood of the options finishing in-the-money (ITM) based on the underlying assumptions and market conditions.

Volatility Annualization

A note in the notebook highlights that the annualization of volatility is specifically for hourly data and should not be used for daily data. This ensures accurate volatility calculations.

Visualizations

The notebook includes several plots to analyze the impact of different factors on the pricing of binary options:

	•	Volatility vs. Option Prices: Shows the relationship between volatility and option prices.
	•	Maturity vs. Option Prices: Illustrates the effect of maturity (time to expiration) on option prices.
	•	Spot Price vs. Option Prices: Depicts the influence of the spot price (current price) of Ethereum on option prices.

Further Pricing Results

Additional binary option prices are provided under different conditions:

	•	Case 1:
	•	Call Option Price: 0.2035
	•	Put Option Price: 0.7965
	•	Case 2:
	•	Call Option Price: 0.2127
	•	Put Option Price: 0.7873

General Observations

	•	Call vs. Put Option Prices: Generally, the put option prices are higher than the call option prices, indicating that the market may perceive a higher likelihood of Ethereum’s price decreasing or staying below the strike price.
	•	Sensitivity Analysis: The visualizations help in understanding how sensitive the option prices are to changes in volatility, maturity, and spot price. This is useful for traders and analysts to make informed decisions based on market conditions.
